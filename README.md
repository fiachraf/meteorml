Code I used for my machine learning projecct based on GMN(Gloabal Meteor Network Data)

There are a lot of results in the keras folder and things are just a bit of a mess and need to be reorganised so that it's just scripts in some folders and then reuslts in a different folder. I also need to create a document that has details on the different network configurations and the differences in input data used for different versions of the model. The .h5 model files are not included as some of them are larger than the free Github size limit of 100MB.

For the scripts in crop_and_convert, the RMS python package is used, I didn't have it installed properly and used a slight workaround to import the code from an adjacent folder and that needs to be changed.

Currently my thesis/report if unfinished but when it is finished I will include a copy here so that it includes an in depth explanation of everything that I did and tried.
