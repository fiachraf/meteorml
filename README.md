Code I used for my machine learning projecct based on GMN(Gloabal Meteor Network Data)

To make use of the code and neural network model I made using the GMN data, all necessary scripts are in the "use" folder

The crop_and_convert folder contains scripts I used to tidy up the dataset and generate the png images from the fits files for training.
The keras folder contains the many different scripts I used to train neural networks on the data along with the performance of these neural network models, and additional scripts I used.
